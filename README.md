🚀 Route-X

AI-Powered Route Planning & Optimization Web App

Route-X is a full-stack web application that intelligently optimizes travel routes using modern frontend technologies and server-side computation. It’s designed to help users plan the fastest and most efficient routes for logistics, delivery, or personal travel — combining clean UI with scalable backend logic.


🌍 Overview

Route-X helps users find optimized routes between multiple locations with real-time visual feedback.
Built with TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, and Netlify Functions, it provides a lightning-fast user experience while maintaining a clean, modular architecture that can scale to production-grade systems.

✨ Features

✅ Smart Route Calculation – Computes shortest or most efficient routes using backend logic or APIs.
✅ Interactive Map UI – Intuitive interface built with Tailwind + modern JS frameworks.
✅ Search & Autocomplete – Smooth address lookup and geocoding integration.
✅ Save & Manage Routes – Store frequently used routes in local or cloud storage.
✅ Dark Mode UI – Fully responsive modern design with Tailwind’s theming.
✅ Deployed on Netlify – Fast global hosting and continuous deployment.
